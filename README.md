# Summary

This mod allows non-renewable items, such as Band of Regenration and Magic Mirror, to be craftable. This is best suited for hardcore playthroughs where items can be constantly lost upon dying.

The recipes provided here are only for functional accessories and weapons; none for vanity sets. Do note that these recipes will cost you a lot of effort to regain said items, so it is still better to find them normally in the vanilla experience. This mod is strictly not a mod to make grinding easier.

One such recipe is Desert Tiger Staff. If a player dies with this in their inventory, it will be lost forever (at least in Singleplayer, or if True Hardcore for Multiplayer is installed). This mod will allow you to craft it again, but it needs 3 Dessert keys.

Have fun with a Game-Over-less Hardcore playthrough!
